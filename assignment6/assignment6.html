       <h1> Stephen King, A Novel Legend.</h1> 
        </header>

    <p1>In an online Esquire article written by, Adrienne Westenfeld. She talks about the authors success and career through award winning stories.</p1>  
        <p1>"Fifty years ago, Stephen King published Carrie, a slim volume about a bullied teenager and the violent revenge she exacts on her high school classmates. Seventy-six books later, King is arguably the most famous writer in America. Through bloodcurdling novels like It, Pet Sematary, and The Shining, the author has carved out his place as the undisputed master of horror fiction. With more than 350 million copies sold and many of his books adapted for the screen (sometimes multiple times over), King’s dark imagination is a dominant force in American culture. Now seventy-six years old, he still writes at a brisk clip from his home in Bangor, Maine. His latest, You Like It Darker, is out now."</p1>

       <h1> What I’ve Learned: Stephen King</h1> 
    </header> 
    

    <p>Stephen King, an author I have known since I was a child first beginning to read. I always enjoyed reading his stories because they were often scary. When I chose to read, these kinds of stories always intrigued me the most. Esquire, a company I typically tend to read chose an interesting way to talk about Stephen King's legacy. 
    </p>
    
    <p>In the second part of this article they reference many saying of Stephen King. His impression of being famous and what comes with the fame. That failing always has a lesson, also learning to be vulnerable. This author has always been a family favorite, this was a great article to read because sometimes its nice to read about the thoughts an amazing writer has.  </p>
