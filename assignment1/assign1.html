	<p>Kate Wagners’ The Age of App-quarius, discussed interesting notes about some of the most popular webcomics, multimedia stories and creative media design in the early 2010’s. She talks about the change in technology, beginning with smartphones. How customization is limited everywhere and apps, originally thought to be a part of the web aren’t websites at all. While the internet was an open platform, apps were created on their own and don’t expand into the web of information. Tech writer Christopher Mims says, “The Web wasn’t perfect, but it created a commons where people could exchange information and goods. It forced companies to build technology that was explicitly designed to be compatible with competitors’ technology.” Then large companies began designing new tech to keep up with competition.</p>
    <p>The power of the web was often looked over too fast, companies started to only consider using apps instead of wasting time on internet browsing. The creative part of website design slowly was being washed away with the creation of apps. From here she talks a lot about where people go, what they look at, and specific niches within the internet that hold place on apps such as Twitter, Reddit or Facebook. How communities grow and share interests all from groups. But the things on the internet all somehow connect. There are a lot of different customizations you can do for your own profile or for others. Some of the first to show this were Myspace and LiveJournal. Todays platforms similar to these in the time are Facebook or Pinterest. She talks about the connection and reflection of cultural attitudes at the time and why some people chose to stay the same or switch to the dominating streamline regulated Facebook. Upon further investigation, a mix of interviewed teenagers had a mixed response to the questions asked about apps like Myspace or Facebook. By 2013, the Myspace web platform was to be flashed out of existence, for newer, simpler apps. The transformation technology has gone through has proven to be beneficial in so many ways. However we know and have learned that the development of the internet has created a dark side. Another important part Kate mentions is how, “the internet has become nostalgia in search of a platform.” Going back to apps and their cultural connections, apps such as Facebook have faced backlash over the misuse of data, promotion of fake news, political charged, etc. Within all of the apps there is an aesthetic born, odd Facebook groups, profile frames, gifs, stickers and many other things that all make an app feel cluttered. With so much information being shared from all kinds of apps and websites its hard to decipher whats real and what’s not. Many apps allow users to grant all of their information to them, while these apps don’t allow any control from the user. What these data companies do with our information will never be known. In todays society its become the norm to allow any site we enter our information or cookie acceptance. Not really ever knowing what we are accepting and where our personal data is going. This is something a majority of people who use apps or the internet experience, it is something we have gotten used to. All of the past technology, before phones, the websites that occupied those spaces have disappeared, the first of the first have mostly vanished.</p>
    <p>To finish my first essay on Kate Wagners story she included a final quote from Marx that finishes off the essay well. Marx stated, “All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.” This quote says a lot about change and how new modernizations will challenge and question the norms of today but mainly how short term, most of the things we think are important, can still change. </p>
